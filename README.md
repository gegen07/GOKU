# GOKU: Mitigating Over-Squashing in GNNs by Spectrum-Preserving Sparsification

Main code for the ICML 2025 paper: "Mitigating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks by Spectrum-Preserving Sparsification"


## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/goku.git
cd goku

conda create -n goku python=3.8
conda activate goku

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.4.1+cu121.html

# Alternatively, if you have a environment.yml file
# conda env update -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

The repository provides two main scripts:

### Graph Classification

```bash
python run_graph_classification.py --dataset [DATASET] --rewiring goku --k_guess [K_GUESS] --beta [BETA]
```

### Node Classification

```bash
python run_node_classification.py --dataset [DATASET] --rewiring goku --k_guess [K_GUESS] --beta [BETA]
```
